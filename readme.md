# Ray Tracing for the agon light

This was originally written by The Science Elf for the TI-84 CE (https://github.com/TheScienceElf/TI-84-CE-Raytracing). I did only small changes to make it compile for agon light.

A ray tracing engine written in C++/ASM for the TI-84 CE. This engine is capable of 

- Scenes of arbitrary sphere and plane primitives
- Difuse and reflective shading
- Texture mapping
- Dithering
- Gamma correct rendering and HDR tone mapping
- Global illumination through radiosity
